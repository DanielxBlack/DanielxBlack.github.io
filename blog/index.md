# {{ page.title }}

This is just a content test.
I wan to see if I can keep this blog going.
Not sure if this would be better than a CMS, but I will give it a shot.

This is mostly filler for now. I'm just trying to see what I can do with this. I will work on adding some actual content later.

This took a bit, and it seems kind of cool, but I don't know if it's the most efficient for what I want to do (upload lots of images, etc.). I feel like that's where a CMS would really shine.

It was fun following this guide for converting my HTML site to Jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/, but I think I prefer a CMS for my Hack the Box posts. It just feels like a more efficient approach for what I am going to be doing.

We will see how I feel after I go through a box or two.
