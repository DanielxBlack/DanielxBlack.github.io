# {{ page.title }}

This is just a content test.
I wan to see if I can keep this blog going.
Not sure if this would be better than a CMS, but I will give it a shot.

This is mostly filler for now. I'm just trying to see what I can do with this. I will work on adding some actual content later.

This took a bit, and it seems kind of cool, but I don't know if it's the most efficient for what I want to do (upload lots of images, etc.). I feel like that's where a CMS would really shine.

It was fun trying to figure out how to convert my site from HTML to Jekyll and falling into all kinds of rabbit holes in the process. It worked out, but I don't know if I wan to continue this route.

We will see how I feel after I go through a box or two.
