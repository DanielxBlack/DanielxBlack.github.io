    <h2>How'd you get here?</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome. You've somehow -- either by accident, or because I linked you -- stumbled upon my site, Tacos N' Security. Unforunately, InfosecNoob was already taken, so I had to come up with something else, and I like tacos. It's a simple site that started out as a small project to help me learn a bit about HTML5 and CSS while taking classes at WGU, but I figured it was worth building upon and maintaining. This site will soon be populated with more things as I start building it and learning more HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a bit experimental. I'm not a web designer, afterall. I just want to learn how things work, and it makes for a good opportunity for me to build something I can use later if some employer decides they want to give me a shot. At least they can see I have <em>some</em> level of skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is mostly going to be a collection of some things I learn and want to share or focus on. I will only update when I can, and I'll say that's not very often when you're a student and work full-time. Either way, this can be a wonderful learning experience, so I hope to learn something new.
    </p>

      <h4>Some background</h4>
      I'm a cybersecurity student at Western Governor's University. In fact, I just completed my first year on January 1st, 2018. It's not a big deal to some, but I'm glad I've gone this far, and that I'm sticking to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been playing with computers for as long as I can remember, but I only recently started doing it as a job. I've learned a lot in the last three years, and hope to learn plenty more. In fact, I built this site to learn some basic HTML and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above, you will find links to my blog, my resume, some cool links and some of my other interests. They are all worth checking out.
    </p>

      <h4>Some of my goals</h4>
      This site is a work in progress, so I'm at a point where I'm trying to figure out whether goals would fall into the about me page or on this introductory home page. Maybe this calls for a quick bullet list that I can elaborate on in the About Me page.
      <br/>
      <ul>
	<li>Learn as much as I can.</li>
	<li><s>Finish school and earn my degree.</s> Finished March 2019.</li>
	<li>Make something of myself.</li>
	<li>Make those I love proud.</li>
	<li>Make myself proud.</li>
	      <li>Of those, I think finish school is the only obtainable one. The others will <em>always</em> be a work in progress.</li>
      </ul>
