    <p>
      I built this site on a Raspberry Pi using emacs because I wanted to learn something. I don't know how practical that was. It's like using LaTeX to put together a document when you have InDesign. It's about learning a cool new skill and challenging yourself. I'm using GitHub pages, because it's cheap (free).
    </p>

    <p>
      I wrote the cheesy music on the intro page, and pretty much Googled how to do everything else. The ascii bunny is just a gif I found and inverted the color on.

      There isn't much else to say about this. I just wanted to try a few things and see what I could create. I may periodically update this site, but its' really just for fun. I am considering putting together a blog, so maybe that will be a thing soon. I never really became fully invested in the one I started when I put this site together.
