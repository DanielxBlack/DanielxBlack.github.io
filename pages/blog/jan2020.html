    <h2>Jan 4, 2020</h2>
    <p>
      Happy Saturday! I've been working on my PWK stuff (most know it as OSCP. OSCP is the name of the cert, and PWK is the course). It's been a great learning
      experience, and it's all been very challeging. I don't know how ready I will be in a week or two, but I know that I will have to keep working hard at it if I
      want to succeed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There are a couple of things I have to think about while doing this:
      1. A lot of people fail their first attempt. (Not that I want to.)
      2. Even if I do fail, I will come out more skilled. I can always retake.
      3. The exam <em>is</em> passible. Many people have taken it and passed it. I can, too.
    </p>

    <h3>Studying for OSCP</h3>
    <p>
      I have no idea why I decided to do this on a static site. A CMS would have been much easier. I just wanted to try it, becase I'm cool like that.
      Remember, this site was originally built on a Raspberry Pi using Emacs. Why? Maybe I'm a bit of a masochist.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyway, I'm studying for my OSCP. Talk more later.
